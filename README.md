# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Features Implemented

## Future Enhancements

Due to time constraints, some functionalities shown in the reference screenshots are not fully implemented. With more time, I would:
‚Ä¢ Split the code into separate components for better readability and maintainability.
‚Ä¢ Implement additional features from the screenshots, such as reordering files or lessons.
‚Ä¢ Add animations and improve overall user experience.

Feel free to clone and run the project using the above commands! üéâ
